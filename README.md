# Image Classification by VGG-16

## VGG-16
The VGG-16 model is a deep learning model consisting of 16 layers created by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) team at the University of Oxford.  
It is a convolutional neural network that came in second place in the 2014 ILSVRC.  
VGG-16 is divided into two modules: features and classifier.  
There are 38 layers in total, but only the convolutional and fully connected layers are counted.
